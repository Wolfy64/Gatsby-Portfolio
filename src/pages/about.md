# PAGE ABOUT

I’m a web **developer**, who changed careers to do a cool job.

I just finished an Bachelors coding course with Open Classrooms. Throughout this course I have learned a great deal when it comes to working independently, to self motivation and therefore to being highly adaptable, one of the greatest assets for a profile in today’s working society.

My goal is now to become a full-stack web developer. I always welcome feedback on ways to improve myself so please do not hesitate to share your advice or tell me what you think, it will be much appreciated.
