  <About>
    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I have always been passionate about coding, which is why after 15 years as
      an optician I have decided to seize the opportunity to turn my passion
      into a career through a <mark>Computing Sciences Bachelors.</mark>
      <br />
      Throughout hackathons, Open Source projects and online certifications (
      {OpenClassrooms}, {WesBos}, {Udemy}, {FreeCodeCamp} â€¦etc).
      <br />I have since then been able to build my own projects, contribute to
      team projects and join ever-expanding developer communities like {
        C0d3
      }{' '}
      without ever stopping to learn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Always looking to improve my set of skills, I am genuinely curious,
      particularly meticulous and have an eye for detail which is why I am
      committed to building a clean, reusable, and easily maintainable
      well-commented code.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am currently specialized in Front-end development and actively working
      on projects including building a <mark>FullStack App with ReactJS</mark>{' '}
      on the front-end on my spare time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Interested in collaborating? Please reach out {Here}.<br />I look forward
      to speaking with you soon, be it hiring or building a website remotely.
