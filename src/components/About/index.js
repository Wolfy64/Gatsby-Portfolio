    <p>
      I’m a <mark>web developer</mark>, who changed careers to do a cool job. I
      have just completed a <mark>Bachelor's Degree in Web Development</mark>{' '}
      with [Open Classrooms][1]. Throughout this course I have learned how to
      effectively work independently and the importance of self-motivation,
      allowing me to be efficient as well as highly adaptable, one of the
      greatest assets for a profile in today’s working society. I would like to
      work as a Javascript full-stack web developer.
