## Summary

---

I have just completed a Bachelor's Degree in Web Development with Open Classrooms. Throughout this course I have learned how to effectively work independently and the importance of self-motivation, allowing me to be efficient as well as highly adaptable, one of the greatest assets for a profile in today’s working society.

I would like to work as a Javascript full-stack web developer.
