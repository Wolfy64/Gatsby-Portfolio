## Why?
Setting up a server is hard, especially setting up DNS records, managing certificates, and deployment. 
So we setup to build a simple and usable app that helps us build applications quickly.

[I wrote a post on DEV.to explain how to use it.](https://dev.to/wolfy64/myproxy-how-to-easily-setup-free-ssl-on-your-server-1j8f)

**MyProxy** is an application that:

- Helps you connect to your Domain provider
- Setup A and CNAME records for your selected domain
- Create and serve SSL certificates for your selected domains
- Run an unlimited number of applications on your subdomains.
