**Project Lead** and **ReactJS Frontend developer** for the open source project "SJParks".

**This project is ongoing.**

They need as soon as possible an App that will be on an online web platform for San Jose use only.

The provided problem is greater than the current deliverable. San Jose has been looking for a fully functional web app that deals with a wider range of services. We are starting with a solution of custom notifications through text directed towards informing regular visitors. 

We started out with this end because the introduction of the informative application will spark interest from regular visitors, and provide the basis of expansion into visitor issue filing widgets and gain immediate feedback.
