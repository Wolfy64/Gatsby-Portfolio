**Quilt** is a simple [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) app that retrieves buisness-oriented newspaper headlines and filters them by color according to their political bias.

This app was made as a **team project** during a 2-day **JAMStack** **Hackathon** at GitHub.

This app was:

* Made with the [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) boilerplate
* Designed and styled with [Styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com)

We used:

* [Formspree](https://formspree.io/), a contact forms API
* [Fauna](https://fauna.com/), a cloud database API
* [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org), a JSON metadata for headlines and articles
